# Studio 54

A 50% keyboard inspired by the bm43a.

## Numeric Row

Besideds dedicated keys for numbers (and, most importantly, their associated punctuation), it lets ESC and TILDE have their own keys, as well as making space for QUOTATION MARK.

## R3

Unlike the bm43a, this layout makes TAB 1.5u, allowing the use of standard keycaps.  It also makes the row symmetric, reducing ENTER to 1.5u as well. Since neither is stabilized, better to go with a smaller (and more common) key size.

## Nav Cluster
